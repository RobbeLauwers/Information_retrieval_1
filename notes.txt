Using small dataset, limiting results to 1:
    using default similarity (BM25 https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/Similarity.html), sort by relevance
        Trying to choose analyzer (index and query), amount of docs in example not in results:
            standard: 61
            stop: 57
            whitespace: 125
            english: 36

English analyzer, chi squared similarity: 47

Looking at https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_1_0/core/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html, textField seems like the only field we should use

Query parsing: https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/QueryParser.html: queries are natural language, and separate queries are given. Most functionality not needed

Queries in example: 5194
Results in example: 80544
Results in our implementation: 155791

results/query
	example: 15.5
	tf_idf npl.npl: implementation: 30 -> probably same for all methods

! using wrong limit, but shows that indexing speed on laptop/desktop was not camparable
