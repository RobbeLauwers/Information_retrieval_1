Using small dataset, limiting results to 1:
    using default similarity (BM25 https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/Similarity.html), sort by relevance
        Trying to choose analyzer (index and query), amount of docs in example not in results:
            standard: 61
            stop: 57
            whitespace: 125
            english: 36

English analyzer, chi squared similarity: 47

Looking at https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_1_0/core/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html, textField seems like the only field we should use

Query parsing: https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_3_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/QueryParser.html: queries are natural language, and separate queries are given. Most functionality not needed

Big dataset tests:
    example results: 80544
    queries: 5194
